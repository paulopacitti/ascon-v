                 RISC-V is a promising ISA and soon will be the architecture of
                 many chips, specially embedded systems. It's necessary to 
                 guarantee that applications that run in systems designed with RISC-V will be at the same time secure and cryptographically fast. The NIST Lightweight Cryptography competition selected the finalist: Ascon, a family of cryptography algorithms designed to run in devices with low computational power. This research explores the Ascon family of algorithms in the RISC-V 64-bit architecture, analysing the Ascon permutation and the Ascon-128 algorithm, and whether it's possible to optimize it for \texttt{riscv64}, proposing a new technique regarding the decryption implementation. The results show that the proposed optimizations, developed during the limited time given to this research, were not enough to overcome all the implementations that were benchmarked. Finally, it's discussed that new microarchitectures, and, the future of the RISC-V ISA with new instructions extensions recently ratified, could improve the performance of the Ascon family of algorithms and other cryptographic algorithms.
