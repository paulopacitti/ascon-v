                 RISC-V is a promising ISA and soon will be the architecture of many chips, specially embedded systems. It's necessary to guarantee that applications that run in systems designed with RISC-V will be at the same time secure and cryptographically fast. The NIST Lightweight Cryptography competition selected the finalist: Ascon, a family of cryptography algorithms designed to run in devices with low computational power. This research explores the Ascon family of algorithms on the RISC-V 64-bit architecture, analysing the Ascon permutation and the Ascon-128 algorithm, and whether it's possible to optimize it for \texttt{riscv64}, proposing a new technique regarding the decryption implementation. The implementation developed in this research was benchmarked in the Allwinner D1 chip, a RISC-V 64-bit 1 GHz single-issue CPU supporting the RV64GC ISA, and compared with other implementations. Finally, it's discussed that new microarchitectures, and, the future of the RISC-V ISA with new instructions extensions recently ratified, could improve the performance of the Ascon family of algorithms and other cryptographic algorithms.
